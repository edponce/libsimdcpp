Intel Intrinsics SIMD C++ library

A C++ interface for Intel SIMD intrinsics. This interface
allows applications to easily and systematically access the available vector technologies.

General requirements:
    GNU compilers, require 4.8 or greater for __builtin_cpu_supports()
    C++98 - function overloading

SIMD requirements:
    SSE - at least SSE4.1 for _mm_mullo_epi32() and _mm_mul_epi32()
    AVX - at least AVX2 for integer instructions, _mm256_mullo_epi32(), _mm256_mul_epi32(), and others
          at least SSE2 _mm_shuffle_epi32() and _mm_or_epi32()

All SIMD macro decisions are ordered from most recent technology to oldest.
This allows the use of best available technology without the user having to specify.
Note that the user is allowed to decide on a specific technology using a macro definition.
The number of streams depends on the width of the vector unit.

Arrays of SIMD intrinsics are allocated using posix_memalign(), using fixed arrays
worked for SSE but not AVX. It seems this is due to compiler (GCC) not providing automatic
support for large vector datatypes.
